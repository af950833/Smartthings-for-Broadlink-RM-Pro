Smartthings Handler for Broadlink RM Pro using RM Plugin, RM Bridge &amp; Home Assistant

I refered to the below.

http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=URI_Switch

https://github.com/beckyricha/Broadlink-RM-SmartThings-Alexa

If you set up one of RM Plugin(with HTTP Bridge), RM Bridge and HA(Home Assistant), you can controll the Broadlink RM Pro with HTTP POST or GET method.

You can controll the Broadlink device with this handler at the Smarttings using the API. This handler doesn't use a smartapp and you can input device URI information at a PC or your phone.(I recommand you to use the PC)

Copy the contents(Broadlink Virtual Switch.groovy) and create new device handler at Smartthings IDE web.

Paste it to 'From code' and save.
(If you are using the RM Bridge, you have to change the both methods from "POST" to "GET" in the code for On and Off)

Publish it 'for me'

Go to my device.

Create a device with '+ New Device'

Input Name, Label, Device Network ID as you want.

Select the 'Broadlink Virtual Switch' at the Type

Select the Location and Hub then click the 'Create'

Click the 'Preference(edit)'

You can input the information about the devices what you want to control
